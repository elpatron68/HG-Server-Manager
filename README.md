## Ntfy notifications

Let your players be notified when you start your game server! *HG-Server-Manager* sends messages to the [Ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) *topic* `Hydrofoil_Generation_Servermonitor` when you hit the launch button.

Let your players never miss one of your races by letting them subscribe to the *topic*! Open [this](https://ntfy.sh/Hydrofoil_Generation_Servermonitor) web browser tab and let it opened. Or - way better! - install the [Ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh/#subscribe-phone) on your mobile and subscribe to the *topic*. The Ntfy app is available for iOS and Android.

### Modify Ntfy topic

The default topic `Hydrofoil_Generation_Servermonitor` can be changed to an individual one by renaming the file `Hydrofoil_Generation_Servermonitor.ntfy` in the application directory. Just change the file name to a topic name of your choice. Note, that Ntfy topics are public for everyone who knows the topic name! If you want to have some privacy, give it a random alpha-numeric name like `qPd5AbhVfwv5FJFQtYRY4xCf`

### Disable Ntfy notifications

To disable all Ntfy notifications, delete all files with the extension `*.ntfy` in the app¬¥s directory.
